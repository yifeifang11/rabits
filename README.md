# Rabits

This is a basic habit tracking app that uses the MERN stack. It supports basic HTTP requests: you can add habits, edit habits, and remove them. Completing a habit will increase your carrots, and if you get enough carrots, you level up your rabbit!

### Installation

To run the app locally on your own device: clone the repo, add .env file in the backend folder with MONGODB_URI=your uri and PORT=your desired port. Please change all axios requests to the correct localhost url (since this version was made for deployment). In both the frontend and backend folder, run 'npm install' to install all packages. In the backend, run 'npm run dev' and in the frontend, run 'npm run start'.

### Future Goals

I hope to implement user authentication for future versions. There is currently only one account for this test version. You can view it here: https://rabits.onrender.com.
